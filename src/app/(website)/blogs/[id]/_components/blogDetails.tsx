          <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-[19.2px] font-normal text-[#444444]">
            Germany&#39;s proposed cannabis legalization represents a pivotal
            shift in the country’s drug policy and has the potential to
            significantly impact the European cannabis landscape. By creating a
            regulated market, Germany not only aims to enhance public health and
            safety but also to stimulate economic growth and set a regulatory
            benchmark for Europe. The success of this initiative could encourage
            other EU countries to follow suit, potentially leading to a more
            unified approach to cannabis legislation across Europe. As this new
            era dawns, the effects will resonate far beyond Germany’s borders,
            potentially transforming the cannabis industry throughout the entire
            European Union.
